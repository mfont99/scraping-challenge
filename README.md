# scraping-challenge
Module 11 challenge assignment

Part one of this assignment was pretty basic, and just consisted of visiting the site, and then using the developer tools to take a look at the HTML. After going through the HTML, it was straightforward enough to scrape the relevant data. 

For part two, most things I got stuck with were answered as hints within the starter code. For example, converting the terrestrial date to a datetime object wasn't my first thought, but nothing I tried on my own worked. Then I noticed the hint within the starter code that said "**Hint** You can use the Pandas `astype` and `to_datetime` methods to accomplish this task." Hints like these were super helpful for this assignment as well as all the assignments.
